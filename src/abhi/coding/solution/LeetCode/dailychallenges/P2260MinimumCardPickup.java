/*You are given an integer array cards where cards[i] represents the
value of the ith card. A pair of cards are matching if the cards have
the same value. Return the minimum number of consecutive cards you
have to pick up to have a pair of matching cards among the picked cards.
If it is impossible to have matching cards, return -1.*/
/*Input: cards = [3,4,2,3,4,7]
Output: 4
Explanation: We can pick up the cards [3,4,2,3] which contain a matching
pair of cards with value 3. Note that picking up the cards [4,2,3,4]
is also optimal.*/
